Stream identifier is a guidance system that aids the ninth and tenth grade school students while choosing a stream by analyzing their past performances in subjects and thus providing them with quicker, simpler, and smoother decision-making process. The code provides a systematic break-down of the grades with a report of performances and two stream preferences (among science, commerce, and the liberal arts) based on calculation and consideration of final grades from the freshman and sophomore years. The user will be extended a report of analysis depicting their highest, average, and a recommended stream all assumed and acquired from computation and mathematics. The code has been constructed from scratch to make it more user-friendly and comprehendible.  The database is saved and thus, everyoneâ€™s data is also saved and projected with the personalized two stream preferences and a detailed report by analysis.

Features:
 - Can enter unlimited data once specified in both tables.
 - A detailed report based on ninth grade and tenth grade GPA.
 - The user is given the two best preferences personalized and customized based on their performances.
 - Easy interface and an unlimited number of students can save their marks in the database.
